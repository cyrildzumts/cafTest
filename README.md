Demo Code Test For the C++ Actor Framework
The  code hosted here are just some demo code to get used to the C++ Actor Framework.
No effort were taken to apply General programming principles.
No effort were taken to used A Custom Type to build new Actors.
This code is the results of 5 Days after that I discovered the world of Distributed System.
I wish I could work  longer on that .
I'm glad I discovered This Framework, it is challenging but I think I will enjoy working with this Framework.
